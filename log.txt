'sudo apt-get install libzbar0 python-tk python-yaml python-zbarpygtk libzbar* python-opencv python-pygame python-zbar python-imaging python-imaging-tk zbar-tools' gets you zbar version 0.8 on ubuntu 10.04 and zbar 0.10 on ubuntu 12.04. 

But the zbar version that comes with ubuntu 10.04 is 0.8. QR is supported from 0.10 on.

So, download the 0.10 source and compile that. 
That needs python-gtk2, so 'sudo apt-get install python-gtk2*' first

But then, how do you get the python bindings? 
This can be done by using configuring the 0.10 build with the --with-python option:
/zbar-0.10$ ./configure --with-python
make
make check
sudo make install

That installed zbar in site-packages, while all other packages were in dist-packages.
So, the files in site-packages starting with 'zbar' were moved to dist-packages.
Then, finally, import zbar; zbar.version() returned (0, 10)

GUI: Several options exist in python for developping GUIs, the standard one being TKinter. 
TKinter has lame documentation though.

Idea: use Festival to do spoken (TTS) announcements
According to: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=751169
Install Festival: "sudo apt-get install festival festlex-cmu festlex-poslex festlex-oald libestools1.2 unzip mbrola"

Installing them though was not documented well enough.
