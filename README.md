pyQrJotari
==========

Kids at http://www.scoutingboxtel.nl get a personal QR-code which they can scan during the Jotari-event. 
This program will look-up which activity is scheduled for each kid. 

TODO
----
- Make the UI blink when a new code is succesfully scanned
- Add images for this year's new activities
- Test this year's setup.
- Maybe do some refactoring in the event loop / polling of zbar
- DONE: Web interface!

Requirements
------------
- pip install PIL
- sudo apt-get install zbar*
